## First Verse 
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Lewis Carrol in this section!-->

And cannot pleasures, while they last,     
Be actual unless, when past,     
They leave us shuddering and aghast,     
With anguish smarting?     
And cannot friends be firm and fast,

In the cradle of azure, the ocean lies,   
Where whispers of waves sing lullabies.   
A vast expanse, stretching far and wide,   
With secrets beneath its shimmering tide.   

It dances with the sun in a waltz of light,   
Where day and night converge in endless flight.   
Its breath, the salty air, kisses the shore,   
As seagulls soar and dolphins explore.   

Beneath the surface, a world unseen,   
Where coral gardens in hues of green.   
Majestic creatures, graceful and free,   
In a realm where mysteries decree.   

But beware the ocean's tempestuous might,   
For storms brew fierce in the dead of night.   
Yet even in fury, it holds allure,   
Drawing brave souls seeking adventure pure.   

So let us heed the call of the sea,   
Embracing its beauty, wild and free.   
For in its depths, we find a reflection,   
Of life's boundless and timeless affection.
