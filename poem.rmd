## First Verse 
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Lewis Carrol in this section!-->

And cannot pleasures, while they last,     
Be actual unless, when past,     
They leave us shuddering and aghast,     
With anguish smarting?     
And cannot friends be firm and fast,     


## Second Verse
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Robert Frost here!-->

The city had withdrawn into itself     
And left at last the country to the country;     
When between whirls of snow not come to lie     
And whirls of foliage not yet laid, there drove     
A stranger to our yard, who looked the city,     


## Third Verse
<!--Put the first two verses of The Walrus and the Carpenter here!-->

"The sun was shining on the sea,  
Shining with all his might:  
He did his very best to make  
The billows smooth and bright —  
And this was odd, because it was  
The middle of the night.  

The moon was shining sulkily,  
Because she thought the sun  
Had got no business to be there  
After the day was done —  
"It's very rude of him," she said,  
"To come and spoil the fun."  



## Last Verse
<!--Put a short poem you created using chatGPT of 20 to 30 lines,here!-->

In the cradle of azure, the ocean lies,   
Where whispers of waves sing lullabies.   
A vast expanse, stretching far and wide,   
With secrets beneath its shimmering tide.   

It dances with the sun in a waltz of light,   
Where day and night converge in endless flight.   
Its breath, the salty air, kisses the shore,   
As seagulls soar and dolphins explore.   

Beneath the surface, a world unseen,   
Where coral gardens in hues of green.   
Majestic creatures, graceful and free,   
In a realm where mysteries decree.   

But beware the ocean's tempestuous might,   
For storms brew fierce in the dead of night.   
Yet even in fury, it holds allure,   
Drawing brave souls seeking adventure pure.   

So let us heed the call of the sea,   
Embracing its beauty, wild and free.   
For in its depths, we find a reflection,   
Of life's boundless and timeless affection.
